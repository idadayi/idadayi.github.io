## Note about the literature in GAS2392 OPENSIM

[link of the article "Activities of ankle muscles during gait analyzed by simulation using the human musculoskeletal model"](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6509470/)

#### aim of this study
using the Gait2392 musculoskeletal Model to analyze and simulate the activity of ankle muscles during normal gait

---
#### Introduction

1. Tibialis 胫骨前肌 anterior worked as a major muscle during gait, producing a higher force than other muscles.
2. Main muscles contributing to propulsion 推进力 were gastrocnemius medial head (GMH腓肠肌内侧头) and soleus (SOL比目鱼肌) with their maximum forces appear to be more than 1.5 times the body weight. 
3. GMH and SOL showed cooperation for maintaing propulsion around left foot initial contact in the gait cylce.

1. extensor digitorum longus (EDL伸趾长肌)
2. TA adn EDL was similarly shown to be around 0.8 in the initial double stance, but the peak force produced by TA is 0.4 Newton/ Body weight higher than EDL.
3. considering muscles, muss consider mechanical forces generalized by these muscles.
4. the goals of GAS
   1. evaluate the pathologic gait pattern and design the treatment plan
   2. prevent bone alignment deformation 骨骼排列变形
   3. prevent muscle weakness and pain
5. measurements for GAS
   1. motion capture
   2. force plates
   3. electromyography EMG
     - infer the force production pattern of skeletal muscle 
      - prudent谨慎的：some variables such type of muscle fiber, muscle length, or muscle velocity are involved in the process of neuromuscular activity during testing leading to mechanical response.
      - cautious about the inference of force during activity from EMG -> different force-EMG relationship between stance phase and swing phase
6.  human: 
    - structured with multilinked segments and connected by muscles (operate in a synergistic form in a motion在运动中以协同方式运作)
7.  human musculoskeletal model
    1.  invasive too -> show how muscles coordinate and contribute to support and propulsion during gait
    2.  calculate degrees of muscle activation and muscle force of individual muscles

    5.  gastrocnemius medial head - GMH 腓肠肌内侧头
    6.  soleus - SOL 比目鱼肌

#### Result analysis
1. SOL
   - activated (peak value) in terminal double support (propulsion period during gait)
   - highest increase rate of activition
2. dorsi flexion
   - TA, EDL, EHL show similar changing pattern -> synergistic muscles -> produce same effects during gait
   - two peaks
     - 1 in right foot initial contact -> smooth grounding of foot 脚平稳落地, as a resistive factor against forward progression of body 作为阻力因子对抗身体前移
     - 1 after right toe off in swing phase -> dorsi flexion of ankle joint to bring the foot forward 踝关节背屈使得脚向前移动
3. plantar flexion
   - GMH and SOL show higher force than GLH
   - GMH and SOL -> more than 2BW before and after L_IC phase(left leg initial contact)
   - Force change pattern differs from activation change pattern.
4. acceleration and ground reaction force
   - the contribution of muscles of ankle involved in propulsion, body support, and resistance based on center of mass (COM), and ground reaction force (GRF)
   - initial double support: a decrease
   - acceleration increse -> advancing forward
5. simulation of muscle activation and ground reaction force with opensim
   - initial double support:
     - acceleration decrease
     - TA, EDL, EHL -> high activation -> support the body (GRF)
   - single support
     - walking speed increase
     - GMH, GLH -> high activation
     - GMH, GLH, SOL -> support the propulsion from middle point of single support period

#### discussion

1. muscle forces can not be measured noninvasively -> human musculoskeletal simulation quantifies the muscle forces
2. different muscle contribution between activation and force
   - the length of muscle fiber is determined by joint angle and moment arm of muscles in case of low musculotendon compliance 肌腱顺应性低
   - the length of muscle fiber is more dependent on the muscle activation and force length velocity effects in case of high musculotendon compliance
   - the level of activation does not necessarily coincide with the magnitude of the generation of the force
   - more reasonable: analyze the contributions of muscles based on the forces <- human movements are made by the mechanical net force of muscles
3. GMH and SOL -> promote the body forward
   1. GML: support and promotion of the body during a single stance period
   2. SOL: propulsion in the left foot initial contact phase
   3. peaks of GML and SOL almost simultaneously 同时
   4. GMH and SOL cooperate to sustain propulsion for a longer time, move the body forward against the resistance caused by initial contact of opposite foot -> efficient driver
